💡 What is System Design?
System design means planning how to build a large software system so that it works well — fast, reliable, scalable, and easy to maintain.

It’s like being an architect of a software system — before writing code, you design how everything should work together.

🧠 Why is System Design Important?
Let’s say you want to build a system like Instagram:

Millions of users
Photos, likes, comments
Real-time notifications
Fast search

If you just start coding without a plan, the app will break under load.
➡️ That’s why you need system design — to create a strong foundation and avoid problems later.

🔭 1. HLD (High-Level Design)
HLD means creating the overall structure of the system — how major parts (called components or services) connect and work together.

It answers "what to build" and how the big blocks will interact.

🔧 What You Do in HLD:
Decide main components/services
How they interact (APIs, databases, servers)
Use diagrams (like architecture diagram)
Think about scalability, performance, and reliability

📘 HLD Example: Design YouTube
If you are designing YouTube, HLD may include:
Frontend (mobile app, website)
Backend services (video service, user service, comment service)
Database (for videos, users, comments)
CDN (Content Delivery Network) for fast video delivery
Load balancer to manage traffic
🧠 This is a bird’s-eye view of the system.

🛠️ 2. LLD (Low-Level Design)
LLD is the next step — it goes deeper into each component and designs the internal structure in detail.
It answers "how to build" each part.

🔧 What You Do in LLD:
Define classes, methods, and their relationships
Use UML class diagrams
Apply design principles (like SOLID)
Choose and apply design patterns (Singleton, Factory, etc.)

📘 LLD Example: YouTube (Comment Service)
For the Comment Service, LLD may include:
Classes: Comment, User, Video
Methods: addComment(), editComment(), deleteComment()
Relationships: A User can post many Comments on a Video
You decide exactly how to write the code — which class does what, which data is stored where, etc.

🏁 What is System Design as a Whole?
➡️ System Design = HLD + LLD

It’s about:
Understanding the big picture (HLD)
Then planning the details to build it (LLD)

🧪 Real-Life Analogy: Building a House
System Design = Planning the entire house

HLD = Floor plan (rooms, kitchen, bathroom layout)
LLD = Electrical wiring, plumbing, furniture layout, materials

🎯 When Is It Used?
In system design interviews (for big tech jobs)
Before building any large software product
In teams when building real-world applications

💡 What is LLD?
🔧 LLD = Low-Level Design
LLD is the detailed blueprint of how your software system will work internally — how classes, objects, methods, and relationships are designed.

It’s about:
Writing class diagrams
Designing APIs
Defining interactions between components
Choosing design patterns (like Singleton, Factory, etc.)

✅ Why Do We Study LLD?
Because building a real-world software system needs structure, not just code.
💼 Imagine:
You’re building Uber.
High-level idea: "Connect drivers and passengers."
But how do you build it?
What classes do you need? (User, Ride, Vehicle)
How will they interact?
How do you handle booking, location, payments?
➡️ That’s where LLD helps: It gives you the detailed plan to actually build it.

🧪 Example to Understand DSA vs LLD:
Problem: Build a simple Food Delivery System
DSA View:
How to search restaurants fast? → Use a HashMap
How to find shortest path to deliver? → Use Dijkstra’s algorithm (Graph)

LLD View:
What classes do we need?
User, Restaurant, Order, DeliveryAgent

How do they interact?
User places order → Order is created → Delivery is assigned
This is LLD: designing the real system behind the logic.

| Topic   | DSA                            | LLD                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Focus   | Problem-solving & optimization | Real-world software structure        |
| Purpose | Improve logic and efficiency   | Build scalable, maintainable systems |
| Used in | Coding rounds                  | System design rounds and development |

There are three key pillars or goals of LLD:

🏗️ 1. Scalability
✅ What It Means:
The system should be able to handle more load or users in the future without needing a complete rewrite.

🔍 In LLD:
Design your classes and components in a way that they can grow.
Follow principles like Separation of Concerns — each class has a single responsibility.
Avoid hard-coding and tight coupling between components.

📘 Example:
If you're designing a NotificationService, don’t just support email.

Make it scalable by using an interface like INotification and implementations like EmailNotification, SMSNotification, PushNotification.

🛠️ 2. Maintainability
✅ What It Means:
The code should be easy to read, understand, and modify in the future.

🔍 In LLD:
Use clean code practices
Follow SOLID principles
Use meaningful names for classes and methods
Add comments and documentation where needed

📘 Example:
If someone else (or future you) comes back to fix a bug or add a feature, it should take minutes to understand what your code is doing.

🔁 3. Reusability
✅ What It Means:
Your components or classes should be designed in a way that they can be used in multiple places without rewriting the same logic.

🔍 In LLD:
Write generic, modular, and loosely coupled classes
Use interfaces and abstract classes where needed
Avoid duplication of logic

📘 Example:
A PaymentProcessor class should be reusable whether you’re processing payments for Uber, Amazon, or Netflix — by keeping it generic and extensible.
