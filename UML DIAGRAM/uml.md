What is a UML Diagram?
UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams are visual blueprints for software design.
They show classes, objects, relationships, and interactions before you actually write the code.
Think of them as maps for your code â€” like how an architect draws a building plan before construction.

UML in Low-Level Design (LLD)
In Low-Level Design:
You decide how exactly different parts of your program will work.
You go deeper than High-Level Design (HLD), which only explains "what" the system does.
UML helps by visualizing your classes, data members, methods, and how they connect.

In C++ LLD, UML helps you answer:
Which classes do I need?
What functions and variables do they have?
How do these classes interact?

| Type                 | Purpose                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Class Diagram**    | Shows classes, attributes, methods, and relationships. |
| **Sequence Diagram** | Shows how objects interact over time (method calls).   |
| **Object Diagram**   | Shows objects and their values at a specific moment.   |
